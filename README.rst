POPPY (Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon) is a Python package that
simulates physical optical propagation including diffraction. It implements a
flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction and point
spread function formation, particularly in the context of astronomical
telescopes. 

POPPY was developed as part of a simulation package for the James Webb Space
Telescope, but is more broadly applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations.
It is not, however, a substitute for fidelity physical optical
design software, but rather is intended as a lightweight alternative for cases
that don't require that much computational firepower.
